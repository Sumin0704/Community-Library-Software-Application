# Community-Library-Software-Application

In this project, a software application was developed for a community library to manage its 
movie DVDs. In the development of this software application, some data structures (Array, 
Binary Search Tree) and algorithms were used to store, manage, and manipulate the data in the 
software application. 
The community library lends movie DVDs to its members and wanted to store and manage 
information about movies and its members. The library lends out movie DVDs from different 
genres and classifications and may also have multiple DVDs of the same movie. Information like 
movie’s title, genre, classification, duration, total number of DVDs is stored in the software 
application. 
Someone who wants to borrow a movie DVD can register themselves with the library through a 
staff member by giving their personal details like full name, contact number and their account 
pin. A registered member can borrow up to 5 movies at any time and cannot borrow more than 
one DVD of the same movie at a time. A registered member can also browse different movies 
available in the library, return a movie to borrow more movies, check their current borrowings 
and check top 3 most borrowed movies of all time. 
The staff is responsible for handling and managing the library by adding new movies and DVDs 
of a movie, removing movies, registering, or removing members, check member details and 
current renters of any movie. 
The application developed by us covers all the given functionalities and has been tested 
robustly for any errors.

The software application has a main menu and two sub-menus. The
identity of the user must be verified in the main menu before he/she can use the
functionalities of the system. It is assumed that the username and the password for
the staff are ‘staff’ and ‘today123’, respectively. Registered members are verified
using their first name, last name and a password.
